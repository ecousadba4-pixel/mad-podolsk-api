/* Minimal overrides kept as permanent token-driven tweaks.
   Removed temporary visual-fix blocks (progress forcing, surface restoration,
   picker width overrides) to allow modular styles to control visuals directly.

   Keep here only small, permanent adjustments that rely on tokens and are
   safe to keep imported last (e.g. modal sizing, toast offsets, animation).
*/

/* Minimal overrides kept as permanent token-driven tweaks.
   This file is intentionally small — most rules were migrated into
   modules (see `modules/_layout-grid.scss`, `modules/_tables-modals.scss`,
   `modules/_summary.scss`, `modules/_categories.scss`).

   Keep only global, truly cross-cutting rules here. If you need to add
   a component-scoped rule, prefer placing it in the matching module.
*/

/* No active overrides remain — migrations completed. */
